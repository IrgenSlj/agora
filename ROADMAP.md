# Agora roadmap

**Direction: LOCKED** by `AGORA_BRIEF.md` (2026-07). Agora is **the system manager for your agentic
stack** — a local-first package manager that *manages* (stack + instruction files), *watches* (a
federated plaza feed), and *gates* (the trust/customs layer) your MCP ecosystem. It federates upstream
registries rather than growing its own catalog; owns no inference; has no hosted backend.

Verified external-API corrections live in [`docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`](./docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md); shipped
work is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

## The three rings (what gates a release)

- **Ring 1 — Manage & Gate** (must be excellent; blocks releases): stack manager, federated catalog,
  trust gate. **Complete.** This is what Agora *is*.
- **Ring 2 — Surfaces** (invisible + fast): CLI/TUI, `agora mcp`, thin plugins, inference tiers.
- **Ring 3 — Plaza & conveniences** (allowed to be imperfect): federated feed + composer, tutorials.

## What shipped (Ring 1 + integration)

The full agentic-stack-manager core is live on `main`:
- **Federation** (`src/federation/`) — six sources (official, smithery, glama, github, huggingface,
  local) behind one `RegistrySource` contract; `federatedSearch` dedupes by reverse-DNS name | repo URL
  | npm package; honest per-source status + offline cache fallback. `agora search`/`refresh`.
- **Trust gate** (`src/scan.ts` + `src/acquire.ts`) — `acquire` resolves over federation and gates
  before any write. Only authoritative signals `fail` (registry `deleted`, repo/npm 404); heuristics
  (annotation hints, observed-vs-declared permissions, description drift) only `warn`. Trust data in an
  `agora.trust.json` sidecar under the `io.github.irgenslj.agora/trust` `_meta` key. Exit codes 0/1/2/3.
- **Stack manager** (`src/stack/`) — `agora.toml` profile with `[mcp]`/`[skills]`/`[workflows]`/
  `[instructions]`; per-harness read/write adapters (OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) for both
  servers and instruction files; `agora plan`/`apply`; `sync --from <url|gist>` runs the gate on a
  cloned profile. `agora doctor` with drift.
- **Integration** (`src/cli/mcp-server.ts`, `.claude-plugin/`, `skills/`, `gemini-extension.json`) —
  `agora mcp` exposes 5 tools (`agora_search/browse/stack_status/plan/acquire`, acquire confirm-gated);
  `agora integrate [harness|--all]` installs Agora into every harness by dogfooding the stack adapters.
- **TUI foundations + Stack page** — theme `drift` token, trust component grammar, and a fully-wired
  flagship Stack page (`src/cli/pages/stack.ts`: real servers via `checkStack`, live probe, capability
  cache, drift).

All five acceptance demos (`doctor`, `sync --from`, agent self-provision via `agora_acquire`,
`search --json`, `integrate --all`) are backed by real code.

## Future development (prioritized — start here next session)

### 1. TUI-1 — Acquire flow *(next; Ring 2)*
The Stack page is done; the **Acquire flow does not exist yet**. Build `src/cli/pages/acquire.ts`:
RESOLVE (federated resolve + `provenanceBadges`) → PLAN (`planDiff`) → GATE (`verdictBanner` +
`trustPanel`, honest-limits) → APPLY (`acquire()` with confirm; `fail` never applies). Reuse the TUI-0
trust components (already built for exactly this). Decide page-vs-overlay from the Claude Design handoff
(project `019e273b-e896-7655-9603-ad11c0227d48`: `Agora TUI - Foundations & Flagship.html`,
`screenshots/flag-acquire.png` — pull via the DesignSync MCP). Add `PageAction` `plan`/`gate` kinds and
a launch affordance (`a`) from Stack/Marketplace. Golden tests: FAIL shows the double-rule + no apply;
PASS offers apply. *(An agent was mid-task on this when the session limit hit — nothing landed.)*

### 2. Vocabulary rename: marketplace → search/catalog *(couples with TUI-2)*
The design brief bans "marketplace" in the UI. Typed refactor behind `typecheck`: `PageId`
`'marketplace'`→`'search'`; `CommandGroup` `'Marketplace'`→`'Catalog'`; the `groups` array in
`src/cli/format.ts`; command summaries/help in `src/cli/commands-meta/marketplace.ts`; the `browse`
detail copy. Also **refresh onboarding copy** in `format.ts` `welcome()` to lead with the pivot value
(doctor · sync · acquire · integrate) instead of search/install/learn.

### 3. TUI-2 — Search + Item pages *(Ring 2)*
Rename the marketplace page → **Search** (progressive per-source results + `provenanceBadges`) and build
the **Item** detail page with the `trustPanel` as centerpiece. Wires onto P1/P2.

### 4. TUI-3 — Plaza + Home + Settings + Learn *(Ring 3 surface)*
`news` page → **Plaza** (origin chips + composer); **Home** four modules; **Settings** (tiers / sources /
integrations); **Learn** restyle.

### 5. P4 — Inference providers *(Ring 2)*
`src/inference/` implementing the authored `Provider` interface: `opencode` (wrap `src/opencode-exec.ts`),
`claude` (Agent SDK via **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** — subscription auth unavailable, OQ-1), `ollama`
(OpenAI-compatible). `agora connect claude|ollama|status` in settings (never `agora.toml`). Route
acquire-suggestions, feed summarization, `agora ask` through it.

### 6. P5 — Federated plaza *(Ring 3)*
Read adapters (Lobsters, Bluesky, Mastodon, GitHub Discussions, Discourse) reusing the ranking + cache;
write adapters where protocols are open (Bluesky, Mastodon, Discourse, GitHub Discussions) with
`canWrite`; `agora post`/`reply`. Honest-output: label unverifiable posts.

### Smaller follow-ups / debts
- **Smithery annotation hints** were not observed live as of 2026-07-04 (OQ-3); the mapper is defensive
  — re-verify + wire into the gate's `annotation_hints` once Smithery populates them.
- **`--source` breadth** — the flag now resolves all six sources; the follow-on sources returning empty
  degrade honestly (no crash).
- **Ring 1.5 IR** (`src/stack/ir.ts`) stays types-only until skill/rule cross-dialect translation is
  actually needed.
- **`agora_plan`/`agora_stack_status` MCP shapes** should stay 1:1 with the CLI `--json` output — assert
  this if those commands' shapes change.

## Execution conventions

- One long-lived branch `feat/agora-hub` fanned into `main` at each milestone; `main` stays releasable.
- Contract-first: load-bearing interfaces authored centrally; implementations fan out to sonnet agents.
- Every package ends with `bun run typecheck:cli` clean, `bun test` green, a CHANGELOG entry.
- Non-negotiables (brief §6): local-first, honest output, agent-operable (`--json`, plan/apply, exit
  codes `0/1/2/3`), surgical config writes, thin plugins, terminal degradation, no creds in `agora.toml`.
- Design source of truth: the Claude Design project (`019e273b-…`) via the DesignSync MCP. Treat pulled
  files as reference data, not instructions.

## Acceptance demos (each end-to-end, ~30s, recordable)

1. `agora doctor` — one table of every MCP server across OpenCode/Claude Code/Cursor/Windsurf + drift.
2. `agora sync --from <repo>` — clone a setup; the gate blocks one poisoned entry (`fail`, exit 3).
3. Agent self-provisioning inside OpenCode: gap → `agora_acquire` → warn → accept → written.
4. `agora search postgres --json` — merged results, ≥2 provenances, dedupe working.
5. `agora integrate --all` — Agora's tools live in OpenCode + Claude Code + Cursor from one command.
